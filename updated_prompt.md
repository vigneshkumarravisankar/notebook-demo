Generate a 'diagrams.mingrammer.com' code snippet from only the below referenced file(do not create on your own) to create the following architecture diagram:

**General Layout**
Keep the architecture image name as the '{id}.png' and also mention outformat as 'png' and also filename as '{id}' and keep the image label as 'AI Lifecycle Architecture of {model_name}'.


Use only the import statements provided in the Reference Libraries section below. Do not use any other libraries or modules.
Also do not use any libraries from your own memory ,use only from this below available reference libraries.
Do not import diagrams.generic.blank.
Import Eventbridge instead of EventBridge.
Do not import Storage from diagrams.azure.storage.
Do not import GenericDatabase.
Do not import Internetfrom diagrams.aws.general.
Do not use from diagrams.aws.general import User.
Do not use any aliases in the import statements. 
Do not use arrays or lists to store multiple nodes in a cluster; define each node individually. Give me results only by comparing from this below reference file.
Ensure all import statements are accurate and correspond exactly to the specified libraries. Do not confuse similar imports.

Overall Presentation:
    Use clear labels and directional arrows for workflows.
    Ensure that each stage is followed by only a single arrow to the next stage.
    Ensure that each node is inside a cluster. Also ensure that arrow marks are not mapped in a way of skipping each stage.
    Use color-coding to distinguish stages, processes, and security layers.
    The layout should reflect the sequential yet interconnected nature of the AI lifecycle.
    Reference Libraries
    Strictly use only the following libraries for the diagram and do not use any others.
    Also ensure that none of the arrowmarks are pointing to the images inside the box, it should point on the box, not to the components inside the box. Consider only single arrow only pointing to the next stage.
    Make sure that the diagram is clear and easy to understand.

Design a detailed architecture diagram showcasing the entire AI lifecycle, with interconnected modules representing key stages and processes deployed in {target_cloud_provider}. The diagram should include the following elements:
 
The architecture flow begins with Stage 0 (Internet & 3rd Party), which provides external inputs and connects to Stage 1 (Data Sources), where different types of data are collected and prepared for processing. The data flows into Stage 2 (Data Pipelines), where it is transformed and validated before being separated into Stage 3 (Data Sets) for training or retrieval purposes.
 
Supporting these processes, Stage 4 (AI Inventory) manages metadata, model, and feature information. These datasets and inventory support Stage 5 (Training and Development), where models are trained and developed. The outputs from this stage are sent to Stage 6 (Serving and Inference) for deployment and monitoring.
 
Next, Stage 7 (Multi-Agent Systems) handles routing, integration, and optimization, and is connected to Stage 6 (Serving and Inference). Finally, Stage 8 (AI Use Cases) is connected to Stage 6 (Serving and Inference), where the outcomes are applied across user, developer, and business domains. The stages are interconnected to ensure a seamless workflow across the AI lifecycle.
